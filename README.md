# Simvastatin-DDGI-Model
Mechanistic PBPK model of simvastatin and simvastatin acid including BCRP expression in red blood cells.

### Repository files
Within this repository, we share a whole-body PBPK model of simvastatin and its main metabolite simvastatin acid. The model was developed using data of 57 clinical studies, and qualified for DDI and DGI prediction with several prepetrator, victim drugs and polymorphisms. 

The MoBi project file contains simulation examples and the observed data of the clinical studies used for model development. For further details, quantitative model evaluation, sensitivity analysis and extensive documentation please refer to [[1](#reference)].
